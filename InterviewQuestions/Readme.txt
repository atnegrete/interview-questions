- Was not able to find solution in time.

- Initial approach, I first attempted to sort through the list (asc & desc by length). Then loop through them in desc order while removing the smaller words.
 Then I proceeded to also remove duplicates of the smaller words. However, this approach did not work because I was removing subsets of the original word with a 
 a smaller word, even though there could be a larder word that would fit.
 A possible solution would be to add more nesting into the algorithim to make sure to re-check all those as well, but that would of increased big o by a lot.

 - At this point I realized I only had 15 minutes left and attempted to research the problem on stack overflow, but ran out of time to implement my own solution
 via the Trie method.
